This dataset is a made-up voting database that includes nationwide voting records for four pressing issues. Votes are made on a per-city basis, and the following four tables exist in the data.

Votes: each row represents a single vote from a person on an issue. The same person may vote for multiple issues, or they may only vote for one. Votes are tied to the city that their citizen is from.

Cities: a bunch of cities, each tied to the state they're in.

States: places where the cities are. Cities are linked to the state they occur in.

Issues: a description of an issue that the people are voting on.

    //This is not the total list as I only copied and pasted half of the result.
    // And of course, Chad reminded me to use limit on the query search to only give me the one result instead of several results and the statement would be written as below:
